World Alive

 Setup to run in a tomcat server, though it would probably run in most servers. 

Create (or copy from this dir) the file :
 /etc/tomcat7/Catalina/localhost/world_alive.xml 
This file should contain the servlet name and mapping

The data files will be created in the data directory, which is specified in 
WorldIO.java  I chose a full file path, but you can always adjust this to 
be a relative path if you want

If you use the same servlet mappings that I used the URL to access the view will be :
http://localhost:8080/world_alive/index.html
